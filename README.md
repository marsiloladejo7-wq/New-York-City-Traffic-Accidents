## Data Source
The project employs a dataset containing information on NYC traffic accidents, obtained from the [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=8&pageSize=5) website, where datasets are made available for practice purposes. The dataset, available in CSV format, comprises a single table, encompassing 238,421 rows and 18 columns. This table captures comprehensive details about NYC traffic accidents, including information such as Collision ID, Date, Time, Borough, Street Name, Cross Street, Latitude, Longitude, Contributing Factor, Vehicle Type, Persons Injured, Persons Killed, Pedestrians Injured, Pedestrians Killed, Cyclists Injured, Cyclists Killed, Motorists Injured, and Motorists Killed.

Subsequently, this dataset was imported into SQL Server for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Processing

A thorough data cleaning and preparation process was executed on the key columns of the dataset involved in this analysis. This ensures that my analyses are based on a solid foundation, leading to more reliable results and informed decision-making. The following processes were undertaken on the key column of the dataset to ensure high data integrity, accuracy, and to enhance the overall quality of the dataset.

**1. Removing Duplicates** 

Duplicate entries can lead to inaccurate results and analyses, as they can compromise the integrity of the dataset, making it challenging to maintain consistency and reliability. While duplicate entries can compromise the integrity of the dataset, leading to inaccurate results and analyses, a comprehensive examination revealed that this dataset contains no duplicate records. This ensures the dataset's consistency and reliability.

**2. Handling Missing Values** 

Handling missing values is essential for maintaining data quality, ensuring accurate analyses, and extracting meaningful insights from the dataset. It is a critical step in the data cleaning and preparation process before conducting any robust data analysis.

After a comprehensive cleaning process, it has been revealed that the NYC traffic data includes 8,783 rows with missing values in one or more key columns. Missing values in the key columns of this dataset indicate incomplete information. Despite the incompleteness, the rows containing these missing values are crucial for this analysis. Therefore, they were addressed separately and were retained rather than deleted.

As they were addressed separately, it was determined that among the 8,783 rows with missing values in the NYC traffic accident data, 7,197 relate to the Borough column. These missing values signify that the borough where the accident occurred is unknown. Consequently, the missing values in the Borough column were substituted with the term 'Unknown'.

Additionally, in the NYC traffic accident data, it was identified that 363 out of 8,783 rows have missing values in the Street Name column. These missing values indicate that the street where the accident occurred is unknown. Therefore, the missing values in the street column were replaced with the term 'Unknown'.

Furthermore, in the NYC traffic accident data, it was observed that 1,287 out of 8,783 rows have missing values in the Contributing Factor column. These missing values signify that the factors contributing to the accident for the designated vehicle are unknown. Notably, the Contributing Factor column already incorporates the term ‘Unspecified,’ explicitly indicating cases where the contributing factor is known to be unspecified or unknown. Consequently, the missing values were replaced with the term ‘Unspecified’ instead of using 'Unknown'. This decision was made to eliminate ambiguity and potential misrepresentation of the nature of the missing values.

With the exception of a few specified columns, all other key columns in the dataset contain complete information.

**3. Validation of Spelling and Categorization** 

A meticulous review was conducted to validate the correctness of spellings and the accuracy of categorization in NYC Traffic Accident data, ensuring consistency and reliability.

**4. Correcting Data Types** 

Ensured that data types are appropriate for each field (e.g., converting date field to date data type and time field to time data type) to facilitate accurate analysis.

The following processes were also carried out on New York City Traffic Accident data during data processing.

- **Added New Columns**

New columns were added to NYC Traffic Accident data. These columns are Year, Month Number, Month Name, Week Name, Week Number, Hours and Minutes. These columns are important in this analysis. They helped in exploring how accidents are dispersed across months to identify any seasonal patterns. They also helped to dissect accident frequency by both the day of the week and the hour of the day to pinpoint when accidents occur most frequently.

- **Added Primary Key to the Collision ID Columns**

A primary key ensures that each record in the table is uniquely identified. This uniqueness prevents the occurrence of duplicate or identical records in the table, maintaining data integrity. Adding a primary key to a column is essential for maintaining data quality, optimizing query performance, and ensuring the overall integrity of a relational database.

After the execution of data cleaning and processing, the dataset for this analysis is now well-structured, consistent, and free from significant issues that could hinder analysis or interpretation. The data adheres to standardized formats and consistent naming conventions. All necessary data fields are present and well populated, the data values are accurate, data types are appropriately assigned to each column, and there are no duplicate records.

## Data Analysis and Insight

The main goal of this analysis is to examine the distribution of accidents throughout different months, aiming to uncover any seasonal patterns. Furthermore, it seeks to analyze accident frequency based on both the day of the week and the hour of the day to pinpoint peak occurrence times. The analysis will also identify the particular street with the highest reported accidents, shedding light on crucial areas for potential safety enhancements. Additionally, the project aims to ascertain the prevailing factors contributing to accidents, with a specific emphasis on understanding those linked to fatal incidents.

This analysis provides answers to the following questions

**1. Compare the percentage of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?**

This analysis involves the distribution of total accidents across different months and inquiring whether there are any discernible patterns that repeat throughout the year. To identify seasonal patterns in the NYC Traffic Accident data, an in-depth time-based analysis was conducted to uncover seasonal trends and patterns in the data, aiming to gain valuable insights into the overall patterns within the dataset over time. This endeavor involved the execution of a comprehensive SQL query designed to calculate the percentage of total accidents for each month relative to the overall dataset. By comparing these percentages, I was able to identify if there are recurring pattern in accident rates across different months.

```SQL
--Comparing the Percentage of Total Accidents by Month

SELECT    Month_Name,
          COUNT(Collision_ID) AS Total_Accident,
          ROUND(CAST(COUNT(Collision_ID)AS FLOAT)/(SELECT CAST(COUNT(Collision_ID) AS FLOAT)
          FROM Tbl_NYC_Traffic_Accidents)*100,2) AS [%_of_Total_Accident]
FROM      Tbl_NYC_Traffic_Accidents
GROUP BY  Month_Name,
          Month_Number
ORDER BY  Month_Number
```

|Month_Name|Total_Accident|%_of_Total_Accident|
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
|January|23024|9.66|
|February|21207|8.89|
|March|25099|10.53|
|April|19180|8.04|
|May|19749|8.28|
|June|20079|8.42|
|July|18872|7.92|
|August|18801|7.89|
|September|18771|7.87|
|October|19148|8.03|
|November|17543|7.36|
|December|16948|7.11|

Based on the total number of accidents in each month and the corresponding percentages relative to the yearly total. 

- The percentage of total accidents varies from month to month, with some months having higher accident counts than others.
- March has the highest number of accidents with 25,099 and highest percentage relative to the total (10.53%), indicating it might be a month with increased risk or contributing factors.
- Other months with relatively high accidents include January, which has a total of 23,024 accidents (9.66%), February with a total of 21,207 accidents (8.89%), June with a total of 20,079 accidents (8.42%), and May with a total of 19,749 accidents (8.28%)
- December has the lowest total number of accidents and the lowest percentage relative to the yearly total (7.11%), followed by November with 17,543 accidents (7.36%). These lower counts in December and November might be influenced by factors like reduced outdoor activities, reduced travel during the holiday season, or increased awareness during the festive season.
- The accident counts in August, September, and October are relatively stable, ranging from 18,801 (7.89%) to 19,148 (8.03%).

**2. Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?**

Breaking down accident frequency by day of the week and hour of the day helps to examining and analyzing the data to understand when accidents occur most often. This process aims to identify specific patterns and trends in terms of both the day of the week and the time of day when accidents are most likely to happen. By categorizing and analyzing the data in this way, it becomes possible to pinpoint certain days and times that exhibit higher accident rates.

To address this question, an extensive SQL query was executed to calculate the aggregate count of accidents occurring on a weekly basis, further categorized by different hours of the day.

```SQL
